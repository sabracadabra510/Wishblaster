If your family is anythng like mine, the more members you have, the more challenging
it becomes to remember when each person's birthday is. Beyond that, how is one
ever supposed to keep up with who wants what for their birthday, Christmas, etc?
Once children are added into the equation, holidays and other milestones become
more like a guessing game as far as when they fall and what gifts to purchas for each person.

Wishblaster allows the user to create virtual wishlists for each member of their family. Each 
user can view and add to the wishlists shared within their family. From Grandma to cousin Sonia, 
users are able to keep track of which milestone comes when and who wants what and where it
to purchase it from. 

Keep the family milestones fun and stress-free by taking the guesswork out of 
trying to remember them and what to get people!
